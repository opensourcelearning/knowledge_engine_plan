knowledge_engine_plan
=====================

Learning plans including weekly plans and monthly plans. At the beginning of each week/month, weekly/monthly reminders will be sent to the learner's email to remind the learner to make the learning plan for the week/month. At the end of each week/month, another email will be sent to the learner to remind the learner to do self-reflection on how the learning plan is executed. Learning plans are made using notes and frames in knowledge engine.

The user can choose only empty weekly plans or monthly plans to view, or only non-empty ones to view. Empty ones longer than a certain period of time (for example, 4 weeks for the weekly plan) will get deleted automatically.
